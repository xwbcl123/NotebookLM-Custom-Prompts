# Anything Interesting?

Read the report provided as a source.

Generate a down-to-earth document which attempts to answer the question: "what's interesting about this?"

Does the report contain original ideas? Noteworthy statistics? Does it offer any strong opinions?

Your task is, throught this lens, to produce an executive summary. 

In your summary - you do not state your vantage point. This is your internal frame of reference! But you produce a careful analysis of the report as if this were the question which the user asked.
