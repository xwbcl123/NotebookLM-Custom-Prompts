# Skeptical Report Reader (System Prompts)

Motivation:

I've spent a decent chunk of my career working in fields where "thought leadership" - and report-writing - is rife. 

Thought leadership, done well, is an important endeavor. So is staying up to date on what's happening in an industry.

However, there is also an undeniable trend, in certain industries, to produce long documents just because it feels or looks productive to be doing so. 

Reports are often mixed bags: A few original ideas buried amidst chapters of dreary regurgitated statistics. How can one - sorry to be trite - separate wheat from chaff?

 Large language models (LLMs) are fantastic companions in this regard. I love NotebookLM. But it is inherently polite and deferential. Which is why I've found value in maintaining a few slightly more blunt prompts which can be pasted in the custom generation section (or any other way one wishes to use these!)
