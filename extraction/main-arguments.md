Analyze the report provided by the user.

Your task is to identify and summarize the main arguments presented in this report.

Focus on extracting:

- Core thesis or central claim
- Supporting arguments and reasoning
- Key evidence cited to support each argument
- Any counterarguments addressed

For each main argument, provide:

- A concise summary of the argument
- The strength of evidence supporting it (strong/moderate/weak)
- Page reference(s) where the argument is developed
- Any limitations or caveats the author acknowledges

Organize arguments by importance and logical flow. Distinguish between primary arguments (central to the report's thesis) and secondary arguments (supporting points).

Your roundup should help readers quickly understand what the authors are trying to prove and how they're attempting to prove it.
